## Weekly Workout Plan

This workout plan is a structured **Monday to Saturday training split** designed to build strength, endurance, and consistency. Each day targets specific muscle groups using simple, proven exercises that are easy to follow, making it suitable for **beginners**, while still effective for **intermediate trainees**.

The program balances:

* **Strength training** (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms)
* **Progressive volume** through clearly defined sets and reps
* **Cardio and core conditioning** with a dedicated long-distance run day

All workouts are organized in a repeatable weekly format so users can track progress, stay accountable, and gradually increase intensity over time. This plan emphasizes discipline, proper form, and consistency over complexity, helping users build a strong foundation for long-term fitness.
